					<p> Ladies and Gentlemen my brothers and sisters good evening and welcome to the Roundhouse we are
						about to begin the most important meeting of our brother from the United States Stokely
						Carmichael and we do hope that after we leave here tonight or before we leave colored people in
						this country would start thinking of doing something to solve our problems in this country when
						you look at this morning's newspapers every one of them you find that there are a lot of
						journalists pseudo-intellectuals who are predicting where the race riot is going to start in
						England the white man has been predicting too long for too long too much about colored people
						and if there should be a race riot in this country I do hope when they think it's going to start
						in Manchester and they're all waiting down there we shall start it in Ladbroke Grove you call it
						Notting Hill Gate boy that's what a white man call it we call it a grove it I know it is very
						difficult for many of my colored brothers and sisters to realize the predicament colored people
						are in this country and most of you unfortunately I've been meeting you for a very long time
						still cannot come to your senses and see that instead of colored people making progress in this
						country we are going backward and backward and backward some of you think that you are better
						off than the unfortunate brothers who cannot get a job because some of you have got a car
						because some of you have got a nice flat you think you are making progress but you're not making
						progress all you are doing is you are imitating the white man's way of life his whole society
						his whole economy is based on the HP and by you taking part and enjoying the luxuries according
						to your luxuries by end by joining in into the HP system you are not getting anywhere there are
						many shades and opinions among colored people themselves and that is because we come from
						different parts of the Commonwealth that's what the white man calls it again Commonwealth and we
						find that because of this there are different kinds of propaganda that were used in our
						countries to divide colored people for example in Guyana I'm sure you only know the situation
						too well where one side was played against the other but in South Africa we find that we have
						got the other side playing against the other and then we find in India we have got Pakistanis
						being played against Hindus and in England now we find that Indians are being played against the
						Negroes there are many of my Indian brothers who really honestly believe that he's not Black but
						whether you come from India Pakistan Africa or the West Indies and when you go and you're
						looking for a room and you see a sign that says sorry no colored it means all of us the white
						man has divided us at home but because of his racialist society he has united us in this country
						let us use this unity in trying to solve our problems for our people so much has been said and
						so little done and yet you find if you take the newspapers and you read you will find that he's
						telling you that you're making progress 17 years colored people have been coming to this country
						and 17 years from then today we have got two policemen and the white man tells us that's
						progress of course it's progress it's progress for him because 17 years ago we didn't have any
						but do you honestly think that colored people becoming policemen is going to solve our problems
						because when a Black man has become a white man stooge he's more dangerous to the master himself
						what colored people needs in this country is a strong solidarity among colored people whereby if
						we were to get together we can form cooperatives housing schemes and take our resources of this
						country and utilize it for the benefit of colored people let me give you an example there are
						eight hundred and eighty thousand colored people in England today don't worry about the white
						man he says one million because when he sees ten Black man he thinks it's a thousand he can't
						count you see and let us assume for argument's sake that every colored man is not working but I
						am pretty sure on the other hand that out of that 880 000 colored people 500 000 of us are
						working and if you work you must spend and if say one colored man spends ten pounds per week it
						means that 500 000 people in this country are spending 5 million pounds per week since we live
						in a capitalist society let us be generous that the rate of exploitation is only ten percent it
						means every week the white man in this country is making 500 pounds 500 000 pounds profit from
						Black people and you know who owned the shops if we were to have our own businesses and our own
						cooperatives we could channel this money for colored people where we can start employing colored
						people to run colored people's affair for colored people and I am sure this is what Black power
						means for too long the white man has been trying to tell us what is good for us and what is not
						good for us my Black brothers let us join with me and let us tell them together that if what is
						good for the Black man is going to be decided by the Black people for themselves when we talk of
						colored people uniting we are called racialists but when the Jews have got an organization and
						they say Jews only it's all right if the Irish have got an organization and they say Irish only
						it's all right when the Greeks have got an organization and they say Greeks only it's all right
						but from the time Black people say Black people only everybody calls us racialist ask yourself
						think for yourself there must be something wrong with them if every time we try to do like them
						we are called racialists when we talk about getting together they tell us that we are racialists
						but when the white man wants to get together he calls it the European Economic Community as I've
						always said and I'm saying it again that anything that is good for a white man is not good for
						the Black man because we are Black and they are white and if this is the criteria of
						civilization in the Western world then colored people must start looking at yourselves once
						again we from the West Indies especially my West Indian brothers we should know best that
						integration doesn't work we have been so integrated we have been so anglicized and when we come
						to this country all we can get is a job on London transport and they tell us that they're not
						prejudiced because they employ us on London transport but have you ever seen a Black person
						inspector have you I haven't you know why you're Black brother you're Black because they told us
						when we appealed to them why don't we have Black bus inspectors they said to us that one of the
						prerequisites to become a bus inspector must be personality can you imagine those old goddamn
						white man standing at the corner coughing six o'clock in the morning when this place is cold can
						you see what personality he has got no my brothers we can laugh and we can talk but I believe
						the time has come when colored people have got to do something very serious the white man tells
						us take it easy we have just set up a new ministry the Ministry of Integration now what is
						integration I do not know what integration is and because I do not know I do not want to know
						and I do not believe in it if the white man really believes in integration when he came to
						Africa why didn't he integrate with us when he went to India why didn't he integrate with us
						when he went to Wales and Scotland why didn't he integrate with them no the Anglo-Saxon swines
						believe that their way of life is the best and wherever they go they impose their culture and
						they impose their way of life so we are going to tell them from one part of the world to the
						other that the time has come when Africa must be owned ruled and controlled by Africans where
						Asia must be ruled and controlled if possibly by Mao and we're in Latin America if we can get
						Caribbean and Latin American unity I am sure Dr. Castro will not refuse to run it see the white
						man is not afraid of the Chinese because the Chinese have got a bomb he's actually afraid that
						if the Chinese would to deliver that bomb would they be more barbaric in using the bomb than
						they had used it in Hiroshima this is what they are afraid of they are afraid that if Black
						people were to get power would we kill as many of theirs as they killed of ours and they always
						talk about five million Jews but they never talk about the millions of Indians and Africans and
						the Aborigines they have killed all over the world the Jews are white that's the trouble with
						the Jews my friend systematic means Black and if Jews think they are white then we will leave
						you to decide that for yourself the English people have tried to share the blame on all other
						people when Hitler was building concentration camps even many contemporary today are trying to
						tell us that the German people were the first people to build concentration camps and none of
						you most of you will agree with me that this is not true because the first concentration camps
						in the world were built in South Africa during the Boer War which was built by the English and
						it was there who built concentration camps where 28 000 people died in the concentration camps
						and only 22 000 people died actually fighting the Boer War which means because of their
						civilization more people have died in a concentration camp that have died actually fighting for
						liberation so we say to our Black brothers our forefathers were stupid maybe too honest maybe
						too religious let us show to them that we are not our ancestors they keep blaming us for what
						our ancestors did but they do not want us to blame them for what their ancestors did are we
						going to struggle with shoulders throw the blame off and we got to tell them that you're not
						dealing with our ancestors you are dealing with us it is true when you came to Africa we did not
						know the uses of gold so you took it but today we know the uses of gold we have come back and we
						want it and if you're not prepared to give it to us then we shall use all means necessary to
						achieve our objective Ladies and Gentlemen the gentleman best suited to tell you more about this
						is my brother the privilege is mine the honor is yours it is my great pleasure to introduce to
						you it's all right he says he doesn't want to talk to you but instead we have got another
						gentleman my brother Phil who will be saying a few words </p>

					<p>salaam alaikum over the past week can you hear me this sounds strange man I'm not hearing white
						man's tools they're defective over the past week there's been a congress going on here or so I
						was told anyhow it's called the Dialectics of Liberation in this congress I'm a participant of
						it and so is Mr. Stokely Carmichael so there's a lot of other people Phil Epstein who is a
						psychiatrist practices in Chicago is also a participant in this congress he's here observing and
						so far he has sat in the audience listening to all what is happening one night we were sitting
						somewhere not going to tell you where you might rate it we were getting high I'm discussing a
						lot of things and the result of that highness is this gathering this evening I'm not here to
						make a speech now you're going to hear that later but right now Mr. Philip Epstein is yours </p>

					<p>I think it's best for me to carry on then from where Michael left off how this meeting came about
						and how I see it in the context of the Dialectics of Liberation one of the things that I
						recognized was that of all the participants in the Dialectics Stokely was certainly unique among
						us that he was the certainly the most significant activist in terms of in terms of just what he
						is doing and there have been many enthusiastic and uh vigorous discussions here at the
						Dialectics and yet who besides Stokely has been carrying out these ideas rather than just
						talking about them and theorizing and perhaps um um who has been living in the Third World
						rather than just talking about it and I think Stokely has been one of them so therefore the one
						of the best things I thought to make the Dialectics of a true dialectics was to have uh
						something more of the nature of this meeting which as I uh look around and I can see that that
						there are lots of people here who haven't been here this past week and um these are perhaps
						these are the these are the people of the movement these are the people of Stokely's movement
						and these are the people of Michael's movement um now I would just like to comment also then
						that that's about the genesis of how this meeting came about today but some of my observations
						of the congress uh to date and it has been a lot of very enthusiastic vigorous talk um a lot of
						militant ideas and at times a lot of sort of angry feelings that have been expressed and I think
						one of the things that I've noticed is that um there's been kind of like a an attempt to
						suppress this this this anger and this uh it's almost a thing like people are trying to placate
						Stokely here well lets you know how do you deal with this Black power and I think some of the
						one of the uh realities that many of the participants of the congress haven't come to terms with
						is how how can they deal with their own uh uh I don't know whether they label it this way but
						fright as it were with Stokely and I think some of this came out last night in the uh for those
						of you who were here last night and uh saw a situation in which uh it almost seemed like it was
						really you know it really wasn't uh rational in a sense now I saw that as good because I I feel
						this was really at the guts level and this is where it's at as it were and it's not uhm all up
						here and I think this is what Stokely has been trying to tell us and the difficulty has been
						that we we still can't appreciate it for that that it really is uhm a guts level thing and here
						we are for we've been going on for a week now um again with abstractions and
						intellectualizations now how is it like one of the uh reasons I came to the congress was what
						what can I do in my role I'm a training psychiatrist and I know as well as many other many of
						the other mental health professionals who are here is that the psychiatric profession is an
						implicit uh sort of unconscious supporter of the powers that be in the status quo when
						challenged about this the psychiatrist will get naturally very uptight about this no they must
						maintain their objectivity they must be objective they just look and they just describe but they
						don't act and this is the part of the this is where their unconscious lies now what about this
						is this the real role of the psychiatrist today I'm trying this is what I'm trying to to find
						some answer to here and this is perhaps one of the major questions of the whole Dialectics in
						terms of not everyone who comes to the Dialectics is a uh uh sort of activist 24 hours a day
						they should be but they can't be in terms of like going out and organizing and talking to the
						people and being in the streets and so forth and so on but they each have a role and each one
						can like be an activist in their whatever level they're at and I think uh one of the other
						things about the uh congress has been that there there's been an attempt to find the answer and
						clearly there is no he answer uh Stokely has shown this he doesn't talk about what every that
						everybody should be a Stokely Carmichael he talks about himself and what he's doing and this is
						how he's active everyone who's here at the congress could in some way act with the type of
						energy and the type of insight and the full devotion to the truths and the realities that all of
						us know but all of us are constantly pushing away and pushing aside and rationalizing so that we
						can maintain our status in whatever role we happen to be in and you know like you're afraid to
						take that step in some way but I don't think that's what's being advocated here everyone doesn't
						have to go out and become an active uh militant out in the streets and what have you but within
						their own some may some may do this some may drop out that's fine but I think everyone can in
						some way define what it is that they have to do and as Stokely says for the white man what is he
						going to do for the white society there I mean this is this is the thing he doesn't Stokely
						doesn't need the help he's doing it himself he's doing it with his Black brothers so what can
						the white man do in this context and again all of us have to seriously consider this question
						and I think by engaging in a true dialectics such as what's happening today where I you know
						like this is really a mixed audience it hasn't been this whole past week this is the first day
						this is happening I think this is good uhm I just wanted to uh also point out the the uh some of
						the other things that have been happening uh during this past week which I think has
						distinguished Stokely from some of the other people who have been at the congress here and who
						have been theorizing and who have been talking in great earnest I agree but somehow it still
						doesn't seem to like uh get off the ground or get somewhere um and this has to do with it's
						clear that Stokely hasn't just been talking he's been working and he's been working damn hard
						Michael has been working also so while the congress has been going on there have been two at
						least two maybe more I'm not saying no one else has been working but this is what what I know of
						and what I've seen but there have been at least two participants who have been working out and
						doing the things that everyone else is talking about while they're talking about it here and
						this is where the real stuff is again because this is the guts level stuff and it's not just uh
						this uh talking and theorizing about the Third World it's living in the Third World because it
						is here and this is what everyone has to come to terms with um so as this has been going on
						there has been a lot of work which has been uh accomplished and I think one of the great things
						when people try and describe well what has what what are the aims and what are the goals of the
						Dialectics is it people are trying to evaluate now is it being successful um from from my pers
						from my viewpoint it has been if only it's if it's only meant the two uh uh significant uh
						activist leaders of the liberation movement if we put in generalities the liberation movement of
						the Third World they have had the opportunity to get together to know one another and to work
						together and somehow when when the scene is over with and I hope this uh the other people who
						have been participating they will leave the congress with the same uh type of feeling and not
						some sort of thing in their mind about how well it failed because this point wasn't made and
						this detail wasn't worked out and so forth and so on but if somehow they take away with them the
						feeling of having met another person who is like somewhere else whether it be America or the
						West Indies or what have you but there's someone else that they've gotten to know very well and
						someone that they uh like this business about you know brotherly love and all that but like it
						really happens and it's not the talk and the people have worked together and they have shared
						ideas and like maybe they fought together about their different viewpoints but if they can leave
						with this sort of thing having happened then I think the congress is successful and I think it's
						set out to it will have accomplished part of that which it's set out to accomplish in providing
						a true dialectics a true opposition of just not just the theory but the action and a synthesis
						will have come about which is personally meaningful for everyone and maybe it can't be quite
						stated that well in words but they somehow carry it inside of them and I think everybody
						realizes that this is what a movement is all about you have to feel it um that that more or less
						uh sums up what I wanted to say we had oh can is this thing working yeah we may have something
						else here which is a uh uh we'll have to see if it will work or not it's a tape recording of
						some of the uh sort of informal sessions that that have happened um which I think would would uh
						give everyone some idea of how how things are how things are accomplished how ideas uh generate
						in terms of ideas which generate between individuals which then have social significance in
						terms of who these people are and what they do and how they act on them for example the idea of
						this type of scene today being a part of the Dialectics and uh if this tape will work then you
						um so at this point I'd like to uh then turn the microphone over to uh Michael who will talk to
						you further thank you </p>

					<p> there were a number of things that Phil said which pleased me very very much like when he looked
						at this audience and he says that today it's a mixed audience and I look outside there and I see
						a whole sea of Black faces that's how I want my mixture to be I don't want anybody to be
						frightened at such a suggestion my brother Malcolm used to say that's his picture up there have
						you ever seen such a pretty Black man that's brother Malcolm he used to frighten a lot of white
						folk a lot of Niggers used to get frightened too a lot of them used to love him on the on the
						stage tonight there are a couple of people I hate I don't want to conduct this as any chairman
						or anything like that because we don't have those people that's the white folk have them but
						seeing that I have the mic in my hand I'll tell you who the people are gotta look this gentleman
						in the corner is Mr. Obi he's from Nigeria he's a member and here in England a lot of things are
						said in the newspapers about myself for example like if you read the Sunday Mirror today it says
						a lot of nasty things which you know are lies they're not true at all but I'm not the person or
						the kind of person to be frightened of I'm an old man I'm an old revolutionary and it's time I'm
						going to pack up my shoes and go to sleep but the young ones like young blood here Winston these
						are the people who you're going to be seeing a lot of and hearing a lot about earlier this
						evening before we all started a white man came up to me by the door and he says it looks like
						you're operating on CP time today now I don't have that kind of dialogue with white men and I
						ask him what do you mean he says CP Time say what's that what's that you know because I don't
						know what it is it says colored people's time well I surprised him asking such a question
						because if you have all these Black people here surely you're going to operate on their time but
						on this question there's something there that needs a bit of clarification or understanding the
						Black man's time is orientated from the agricultural society the sun rises in the morning and it
						sets in the evening and if a Black man is talking to his brother or anybody else and he says
						I'll see you in the morning or I'll see you in the evening it's never something like I'll meet
						you at four o'clock or two o'clock or three o'clock that's because in our societies we operate
						with the rising of the sun and the setting of the sun it's a very simple thing the white man he
						operates he punches his clock with the industrial revolution and all that type of thing he
						punches his clock in at six in the morning he punches it off at six in the evening and he and he
						fixes up his whole life in relation to the clock we don't as a result of that he says we are
						terrible we are unreliable we are this we are that we are the next that's his style if you will
						begin to try understanding maybe we can talk some business but we can't now for centuries Black
						men the world over talked of things like understanding the problem they were very busy
						understanding what is happening they were very busy for many centuries our forefathers talking
						about compromising in certain situations and get into some work in format between the Blacks and
						white peoples in the past 50 or 60 years or so the mood changed some 15 20 years ago the
						hustlers in New York and other parts of the state started working more in more recent times with
						the coming of people like my present teacher the honorable Elijah Muhammad there was a bit of a
						change like today I am here just me me one on as a Muslim together with one or two other Muslim
						brothers who are sitting here that's all but people talk about Black Muslims and you have a
						whole lot of policemen hanging about out there they expect riots riots strange word well I don't
						believe that we can compromise or understand or find out what the white man is talking and let's
						sit down and talk about it and all this type of thing because while we're talking about it he's
						busy outside there kicking my brother's head in and I I don't I frankly I don't see how it is we
						can sit down and talk over the situation why and forget the action while it's happening out
						there I think we have to get involved in the action and go outside and help this fellow who is
						getting his head broken in all of us sometimes when we talk and we say things like these because
						of where we come from and how we are and I'm deeply ashamed about it I find that I speak in a
						very apologetic manner as if I'm apologizing for what I am well I'm not I'm not doing that at
						all I know that words are applied to us like racist like you're racist well this is true I am I
						am a racist because the definition of this racism as far as I understand it is people who love
						their own well I love my own and I am willing to die for my own once upon a time we were few who
						would say things like that I know that the vast majority if not all of the Black people inside
						of here are today thinking this very same way if the white man is frightened don't worry about
						that we have been frightened for centuries I get frightened when I walk outside there and I see
						a whole lot of white men I get frightened when I walk from my house to the tube station and all
						what I see a white man and it's late at night I get very frightened once I lived down in Notting
						Hill and my wife she moved from there to Islington she had a very strange complaint she says I
						want to go back to the Grove he says but why baby look I bought you a nice house now you know
						you have a nice place to live for us and the kids she says but I don't feel safe here this is
						the type of society that we are living in a lot might be said about the Black men who it is
						walking down the streets with white women I've heard a lot about that in the past days well I
						was doing that not too long ago either but I know what I was doing I was selling them the
						revolution needed bread and you know when it is it was needed for labor to be transported back
						to the Caribbean area that they picked up our slaves and Black people and threw them over there
						to cut sugar cane and do all my of menial jobs for free well I discovered when I came here when
						I wanted to work that one of the the highest saleable commodities was white women so I went and
						got me a few to sell when we speak the truth like this some of our people get quite offended
						about it and they say those are not nice things to say my brother Malcolm told me anytime you're
						talking anywher e speak the truth he says it's easier that way people may look at us and say
						they're a bunch of crazy Niggers a lot of white people inside of here may say something like
						that well this crazy Nigger was looking at this house and it's all wood all the way around and
						there's only one exit only one there are four Black men at that door and he ain't letting
						anybody out that's another crazy Nigger like me this is very good for you to take a look at and
						listen very very carefully the white ones I'm not really worried about what it is you evaluate
						from these things but this is the mood of the people and this is what it is they believe and
						this is what they feel they don't say things that they don't feel they're not like that they
						don't they haven't learned how to lie they're loving and they're kind Black people all of us are
						we love everybody like mad we have been loving them so god damn much for the past 300 years that
						we loved ourselves almost into the ground unto death here in this part of the world today and in
						America there's a new movement which moved up which we here call the hippies and flower people
						quite a few of them have been into the other days of the Dialectics a lot of strange questions
						were asked they say that their philosophy is love that they love everybody that's what they say
						now love is something that I know a lot about because I love to love it just knocks me out but
						loving is something which comes from down here in the gut right down here you feel it when you
						love and you love someone you're willing to die for them to die for them for the one that you
						love the white people who talk about love are willing to sit inside of this blasted hole and
						intellectualize about love talk about it what a wonderful thing it is and how it is we all love
						each other that's not love that's something else I have a lot of hope for these hippies because
						I'm hoping that they will eventually find the true way and they would look at people who know
						about this thing who can tell them who has been devoid of love all their lives and maybe
						something can happen it is useless really for me to go all the way on in talking about this love
						because the majority of people are Black and if any of the white ones want to know some more
						about it then I'm sure Stokely will tell you how it is we love each other he'll tell you what it
						is he's doing about this love yesterday a young girl came here she was standing right over there
						and she was very very disturbed over what Stokely was speaking and she started to phrase some
						questions at him throw some questions and she made a very strong emotional type of talk she was
						shaken she was trembling when she was finished and she was passing out and she I told her look
						I'm sorry you know because I was she's a human being and I felt very sorry for her and I wanted
						her to know that I felt sorry for her and I had to tell her but when I told her this she wanted
						to know some more about now that she found an understanding Nigger she wanted to me to tell her
						well what can be done so I told her exactly what can be done she had to go home and kill her
						mother and her father there's nothing else that those white people who it is understand our
						problem and who are busy telling us that they love us there's nothing else that they could do
						but to go home and kill their mothers and their fathers because their mothers and their fathers
						are the vicious racists who it is they come and tell us exist since they can come to us and tell
						us about this awful vicious white man who is out there they come under many guises they call
						themselves white liberals they call themselves many things but when they come telling us about
						those vicious white people remember it's their mothers and fathers they're talking about and
						there is no other way for them to really prove themselves to us because prove themselves they
						must talk is very very cheap and a lot of them come with all of this fancy talk and they have
						been doing it a long long time during Stokely's talk yesterday some other things were said
						people were attacking him fools of course and wondering what has he done rather than stand on a
						platform and talk he's been in jail 35 or something like that times it's so much you can't even
						look can't even remember them four Black people fought on the streets was beaten and not easy
						they had to put up a fight but when he turned along and he asked that white man what have you
						done he hadn't an answer that white man was about 27 or 28 years of age he couldn't answer that
						question over the past week a lot of people have been ringing up and asking look at could we
						come up and spend an evening with you because they know Stokely was there and they know that
						brother George this is brother George Ware I didn't even see him behind me brother George Ware
						who flew over from America with Stokely a lot of people wanted to spend an evening or two with
						us and talk because this is our way you know how we love each other but my house is not big
						enough to have everybody we attempted an experiment to tape our evenings what we were doing
						talking how we sit what we say to each other and hope that through this tape we can bring our
						sitting room into the Roundhouse and allow you to have the experience of the evening even though
						you were not there there's nothing edited about it so there may be long gaps of silence there
						may be anything I have no idea what is on it just tapes kept running all the time we'll attempt
						to see whether it is it is possible for the sounds from these tapes to come out to you and hope
						that in this it's the best that we could do until when we have a bigger house after this tape if
						it works we'll switch over to brother Stokely I think uh where where this seems to start is uh
						this was a tape from last night actually and I think we George was starting to discuss the uh
						the Diggers and what uh you know what their scene was what are they doing uh how does this how
						does the uh Diggers movement or uh as part of the hippie dropout movement how does that relate
						to an activist Black movement um and how does it relate to all other movements and what have you
						we'll we'll try it now first time me I'm trying to find myself and all that it's another thing
						to struggle to do that I mean not just can you understand any of that okay um okay well then
						we'll carry on with uh like things that you can hear and uh Obi will speak now</p>

					<p> well brothers and sisters I'm sure we're all dying to hear Stokely Carmichael the great man
						himself so I'm going to be as brief as possible all I'll try to do is to introduce the man I
						know as one of the greatest Black men alive today Stokely Carmichael you see I think the most
						striking thing about this meeting is that when you look up here you see a Black man all the way
						from America the Northern States of America and you find another Black man from Guyana you find
						another Black man from Africa as you can tell from my jungle robes and I yes the Englishman
						keeps telling me I've come from the jungle but I was here only one week and I discovered I've
						come from one jungle to another so we are here tonight to see that one jungle does not eat up
						another jungle however you see Black people from all parts of the world coming here today and
						we're all saying the same thing the white man is dead the white man is dead and to explain this
						over a hundred years just over a hundred years ago a German philosopher called Nietzsche made a
						startling statement to humanity he told them that God was dead and everybody was startled but
						what actually Nietzsche was talking about he wasn't talking about the physical death of a God he
						was talking about the psychological attitude of his own contemporaries and today the Black man
						is beginning to tell the whole humanity that the white man is dead the white man has an idea of
						that human being who defines what is good and what is wrong the white man who looks at the Negro
						has a clay for molding they come to Africa and they see me as a barren slate where they go to
						engrave their convictions that white man is dead he died in Hiroshima he died in Nagasaki that
						white man died in Sharpeville in South Africa and today he's dying in in in in in Vietnam he's
						dying today he he's dying today in Newark in New Jersey where even a bigger meeting of Black
						power is taking place this very minute the white man is dying every day and this is why today I
						say that Stokely Carmichael not only represents a human being he represents an idea an idea
						which is a new milestone in the Negro consciousness he represents a new note in the dialectical
						progression of the Black consciousness we've come to a stage when we look at the white man in
						America oppressing us we look at the white man in Canada who wouldn't even let me in when you
						studied the Canadian law remember the European preferential migration act when you go to
						Australia it‘s the white Australian policy they won't even let me in you go to South Africa
						today it's apartheid in South Africa they'll let me in but they want to sit on me you go today
						to Rhodesia they call it UDI and Harold Wilson says it's killing kith and kin so the Black man
						has come to realize that the only way to fight this international white power is through
						international Black power you see when when when I I had the opportunity when I had before I
						left this country for America recently every white man was anxious to tell me you see the Negro
						in America he doesn't like the Africans you know he doesn't like you at all he he has nothing in
						common with the African but when I went over there the American Negroes insisted that I come to
						every meeting they had in my national costume because they want to feel they belong to Africa
						and when I was in Atlanta Georgia in Vine City there's a hostel over there where Stokely
						Carmichael's party the SNCC have their national headquarters and when I went there and I saw
						Black boys and Black girls singing not about the queen of England not about not about the
						president of America but about Oginga Odinga of Africa to me this is something fantastic it was
						beautiful and I felt beautiful and came back here and say the Black man is not dead yet we're
						very much alive the white man is dead so the man who is going to expand on this philosophy today
						is the great man himself Stokely Carmichael but right before I ask him to speak to you I want to
						ask you when Stokely comes to London and speaks to you and then he goes away what are we going
						to do where do we go from there because in my experience I've seen lots of militant Black people
						come from all parts of the world they speak to us come here and we listen and we cheer them then
						we go back again nothing happens so we treat them like entertainers when you listen to them and
						they go away it's like going to the London Palladium to hear Bob Hope the time has come when we
						are going to say what are we going to do because this is a universal Negro struggle so here you
						have an organization that is calling you to come to contribute all you can to make sure that the
						Black aspiration is a reality so Ladies and Gentlemen Stokely Carmichael </p>

					<p> thank you very very much good evening or good afternoon it's very good to be here we've come to
						understand that the English government will probably not let us come back to their country after
						this visit we had planned to stay until Thursday but unfortunately we have something very
						important to do and we'll have to leave England tomorrow afternoon so that what we thought to do
						since this will be our last public speaking is to bring together most of the things that we've
						been saying all week so that to some of you who've been around it may sound a little repetitious
						we would ask you to bear with us and we'll try and tie it all up together now I wanted to
						introduce George Ware who Michael already introduced for a number of reasons I think that what
						happens in the United States is that a lot of attention is focused on me and so you sort of get
						the impression that there isn't anybody else doing anything that is not true the only reason
						that I've become important as a symbol in the United States is because of the work of my young
						Black brothers inside that country if I were doing it all myself I would be in fact irrelevant
						now one of the things I usually I could say about George very simply since he's been introduced
						but it's very important for you to get the concept when the Nashville rebellion broke out in
						April in Nashville Tennessee George was arrested for inciting to riot when he went to the court
						you must understand the scene there's a white judge all around in front of the courtroom are
						white people and for once the people observing were all Black that's very important because
						nothing scares white people like a lot of Black people coming together and if you don't believe
						that's true now I've been at the Dialectics here all week and I've seen the place more crowded
						than this with white people I have never seen any policemen outside the door never seen them
						today was the first day that I've seen four or five policemen outside the door and that of
						course is because Black people are coming together we were allowed in the past white people
						allowed us to come together but only for three things to sing to dance and to pray to their
						white Jesus but any time any time we came together to do anything else they had to break up the
						meeting now when George was in court he kept talking and the judge picked up his gavel and
						wrapped it he said if you don't shut up I'm going to charge you with contempt of court and the
						entire courtroom got quiet and George looked at him and looked at all the white faces around he
						said you will charge me for contempt of which court and the judge said this court and he said
						and who is going to charge you and your race for contempt of justice and that's very important
						because whenever the white man starts off he starts off from his point when we start off we must
						not start off from his point we must start off from our point very very important let me give
						you a contemporary example of that Mr. Muhammad Ali who is the greatest man alive today and it's
						important to note how white people cannot call him by his chosen name Muhammad Ali but insist on
						calling him by his slave name Cassius Clay yet any time a white English man or woman becomes an
						actor and she he or she changes their name they can accept that change without even questioning
						it but they cannot accept the change of Muhammad Ali but let me show you how they start from
						their point when Mr. Muhammad Ali told the United States army in essence to go to hell and fight
						their own racist war the World Boxing Championship Commission made up of white men it's
						important to note that most of the boxers today are Black made up of white men said that they
						were going to take the title away from Muhammad Ali my question was who the hell are they to
						take the title away from Muhammad Ali they did not give it to him they did not give it to him
						Muhammad Ali is the world's heavyweight champion of the world because he beat the hell out of
						every white hope they put up and if the boxing commission wants the title they've got to get in
						the ring and take it from him and take it from him so it is absolutely absurd for us to debate
						whether or not they have the right to take it away they do not have the right we must make them
						irrelevant to what we have to do Muhammad Ali is still the world's heavyweight champion of the
						world then one other current observation we have seen in all of the papers that they've been
						calling us racist I have noticed that all of the press people who have been covering the
						meetings are all white there isn't one Black man among any of their newspaper staff yet they say
						we are racist and they expect me to have a silly argument with them on whether or not I am a
						racist that is absurd terribly absurd they don't have a Black man among them obviously they're
						racist why should I discuss anything with them and what we want to do then today is to tie a
						number of things together because our objective is to let people know that our intention is to
						carry on where our patron saint brother Malcolm X started us we are going to internationalize
						our struggle we are going to internationalize internationalize our struggles from the Fiji
						Islands through Malaya through Vietnam through China through Africa through Asia through Latin
						America and to the Middle East through the Caribbean we are going to internationalize our
						struggle because we're fighting an international capitalistic and racist system we want to
						discuss today self-condemnation we want to discuss today definitions who have imposed them how
						they exist we want to discuss today cultural integrity and cultural imposition we want to
						discuss today violence as it will become necessary for us to make white people's discussion of
						violence irrelevant to our struggle we want to move on to talk about law and order we want to
						talk about justice we want to talk about the standards of living around the world we want to
						talk about the white liberal as we view him not as he views himself we want to talk about the
						importance of guerrilla warfare as a means to attaining our ends we want to talk finally of the
						need of colored peoples around the world to come together and save our very humanity that is
						what we want to talk about now then the white philosophers the white existentialist philosophers
						Camus and Sartre who cop out they cop out on the question raise the question about self
						condemnation is it possible they ask for a man to condemn himself they never answer the question
						even Sartre you know cops out because he writes the introduction for my other patron saint
						Frantz Fanon in the Wretched of the Earth and after three pages of the most hostile condemnation
						of white Western society that I have ever seen he said but we can be saved if we listen to this
						prophet which is clearly nonsensical because if a man were to condemn himself he must impose his
						own punishment upon himself he must punish himself and therefore become his own executioner that
						is impossible because people are not going to commit suicide that easily and if in fact white
						Western society wherever to sit down by itself and to analyze the crimes they have committed
						against the peoples of the world they would have to commit suicide that would be the best thing
						they could do for the world today so that it is crystal clear that they're not about to condemn
						themselves they are going to rationalize away their guilt that rationalization will be at the
						expense of the people in the Third World we cannot allow their rationalization at our expense if
						there is a condemnation to become about the condemnation will come from the victims we are the
						victims we will condemn we will impose the sentence and that is what we must begin to understand
						as we move white Western society is a Christian society they believe in the bible they ought to
						read it very carefully so they say it says that the sins of one generation will follow the other
						generations to come that's the bible their book now we want to move on from self-condemnation
						the reason why that's important is because I think that a lot of Black people when I use the
						word Black I use it very loosely I use it in equivalent to the Third World to the colored
						peoples of the world the reason why white and Black is so sharp first in the United States is
						because it is very sharply drawn in terms of the divisions that's occurring inside the United
						States we see it sharply drawn around the world in terms of white Western society as opposed to
						the peoples of the Third World that is the colored peoples who white Western society has
						exploited when we use the word white Western society we speak of England we speak of the United
						States we speak of France we speak of Germany and we speak of Russia and when we use the word
						white we do not so much talk about the color of the skin as we talk more about the ideology that
						white people happen to be trapped in unfortunately for most white people the color of the skin
						is the basis from which they react and begin to move to intellectualize around the questions of
						the struggles in the world that is their problem not ours we should not accept it let them solve
						it we have other work to do very very important we want to talk about definitions because I
						think that has been our trap as people of the Third world we have never been able to define
						anything all the definitions have come from white Western society they have been imposed upon us
						and we have accepted them that has been one of our biggest downfalls the white man says when we
						were reading in college we read the history of Western civilization we never even questioned we
						thought they were really civilized we never questioned what it should read is the history of
						Western barbarianism because they have been barbaric they have been barbaric but because we
						accepted that they were civilized we accepted the opposite of that that everybody else was
						uncivilized and since we came from every place else we were uncivilized we developed in our
						minds hatred of ourselves hatred of our cultures hatred of our people and we tried to imitate
						white Western society because we wanted to be civilized it's getting hot it's cause we draw heat
						what white Western society was able to do was to define for the whole world not only what is
						civilized and what is not civilized but to define the very births of people wherever they are
						whenever you read a book of history nothing begins until the white man discovers it and what the
						white man was saying to us was that all people who are not white are non-existent until we come
						into contact with them that's precisely what he was saying and that any time a white youth
						repeated that statement he was being inculcated with his own racism which he was incapable of
						understanding isn't it racist for a white man to say that Marco Polo founded China when the
						Chinese were flourishing with a civilization the white men were in caves in caves isn't it
						absurd for them to say that Columbus discovered America when Columbus got there he found people
						there in addition to that Columbus was an ignorant white man he was so stupid he called the West
						Indies West and the United States East and said he was in India and named an entire tribe of
						people Indians and one of the Caribbean we did not wake up until so Walter Raleigh came along
						and discovered us and all of our history begins when a white man comes along and says poof I
						have discovered you come alive Black land so that one of the greatest fights that the people of
						the Third World are fighting today is a fight to write history the way it's been written the
						correct way and to destroy the lies that the white man has told about history that was the
						biggest fight the fight of the people of the Third World today is to recognize that the white
						man invented little but lied about everything the Chinese first discovered gun powder not the
						white man the Chinese were civilized people they never developed gunpowder as a means to
						conquering other people they left it alone it was the white man who used it as a force to
						conquer other peoples around the world around the world very very important a current example
						one which is very relevant to me do you remember in World War II when Winston Churchill got up
						and read his poem about if we must die urging all of the English people to take up arms against
						Germany if we must die oh let us nobly die and everybody went to a fever pitch did you know that
						poem was written by a Black man from Jamaica named Claude McKay and did you know that Claude
						McKay wrote that poem for us but they have co-opted everything we have used it for themselves
						and then given it back to us they have legitimatized our culture and that is what we must fight
						we must legitimatize our own cultures wherever they may be that is very very important the white
						man's definitions is what we find ourselves trapped by his definitions of what is good and what
						is bad his definitions of what is reasonable and what is unreasonable his definitions of what is
						savagery and what is not savagery and that is perhaps where we've really been trapped because
						the white man has been suddenly making us hate ourselves I was surprised when I looked at
						television in England just the other day and saw a movie of Bwana still running around Africa
						giving orders to little picaninnies would think that even in 1967 the dumb white man in England
						would come to realize that that's nonsensical the days of Tarzan are over understand the Tarzan
						concept because it's very important to us we were made to cheer for a white man to beat up our
						ancestors very very important we went to the movies and cheered for our white man Tarzan to beat
						up our people and what was Tarzan saying they were saying to us that Tarzan who is a white man
						and because he's white therefore superior can come to our environment understand it better than
						we whenever our tribes had an argument with anybody or with the elephants we went to Tarzan to
						come and settle the strife you must understand that syndrome because so subtle was it that we
						did not even recognize it and we did not rebel whenever they showed Tarzan we should have burnt
						the movie house down to the ground to the ground but rather than rebel we accepted we cheered
						and we wanted all of us to be Tarzans all of us wanted to be a Tarzan today brothers and sisters
						when Tarzan comes on the movie you yell for the Black people of Africa to come together and beat
						the hell out that white man and send him back to Europe where he belongs and analyze if you will
						Tarzan here we were identifying with an ignorant white man he couldn't even speak English
						ohohohohohohoho and here we were yelling for Tarzan here Tarzan is swinging on vines while Dr.
						Nkrumah was flying around the world in his own jet airline so that our fight today in one of the
						most important fights is the fight for the freedom of the minds of our people we are fighting
						for the minds of our people wherever we are that we are fighting to get the minds of the people
						away from the white man because once he has their mind he has them hook line and sink line and
						sink and that our war today must be waged on many fronts the most important front is the front
						of propaganda understand today that the communication system which is the most important front
						for propaganda is controlled by the white man the news you get about African Americans
						struggling in the United States come to you through the BBC the news that we get about you comes
						to us through NBC the news that everybody gets about China and the Red Guards come to us through
						AP UPI and WPI the news that you get about Africa about Zimbabwe about the Congo about Nigeria
						about Tanzania comes to you from a white newspaper and for you to believe the nonsense that
						these newspapers are objective is for you to believe the distorted history that the white man
						has been teaching you for so many centuries those newspaper clippings are neither objective nor
						are they true they are downright lies aimed to maintain a system of white supremacy wherever
						they are notice the lines they begin with the Congo is reverting back to jungles the savages are
						eating up white people now before we move on I just want to give a little parody paro... little
						tale that I learned about savages from a friend of mine an African brother he said that in World
						War II there was a white major in the RAF who had been to Oxford and Cambridge very scholarly
						man and he'd been fighting in the war his plane was shot down in africa when his plane was shot
						down African tribe who were around where the plane was coming down had never seen a white
						parachute they thought it was a white bird and when this thing came sailing down they all ran
						with their spears to see what it was when they got close to it they saw that it was a man just
						like them except that he was colorless the Africans assumed that he was colorless because he'd
						been unconscious and the blood must have run out of his face so they picked him up and took him
						to their tent and they took care of him after about a week or so the major began to move around
						but his color would not come back after a month they reached the point where they could
						communicate with each other so on the day when they were going to find questions the African
						president invited all of his dignitaries with their their dress to come and to talk with the
						colorless man who are you ask the Africans well I'm colonel uh Churchill he said and um well
						what are you doing they said he said well I'm come from England and we're involved in a war
						you're a warrior yes oh well the Africans jumped up and down that's very good cause they were
						also a warrior tribe they were called cannibals by the white man but they were warriors so they
						understood that well how is it going is your team winning or losing the Africans said oh we're
						winning said the colonel we are winning and he had all these medals and they asked what are all
						these badges he said these are medals for me myself I alone have killed 30 of the enemy you have
						killed 30 of the enemy by yourself single-handedly exclaimed the Africans yes yes he said they
						threw their spears in the air they threw their shields in the air they jumped up and down what a
						feast you must have had my good man what a feast you must have had but the English major since
						he was civilized jumped back and snorted out of his nostrils my good man I am from England we
						are civilized where I come from I am an Oxford graduate a graduate of Cambridge I represent the
						epitome of civilization we do not eat people where I come from the Africans looked very puzzled
						and said why the hell do you kill them so that what has happened is that the white man has been
						able to define savagery savagery are those who kill and eat but those who kill and leave alone
						are not savages they're civilized so that what we must see in our minds is that while there may
						be problems of all humanity in achieving a way to live together the white man has no monopoly on
						being civilized he is uncivilized very very important concept we want to go on and just show how
						that works see the white man is the oppressor no one can deny that but what he does is that he
						never says he is the oppressor what he says for example if he's oppressing Zimbabwe if he's
						oppressing Malaya if he's oppressing Guinea if he's oppressing Guyana he says that you're not
						ready for your democracy yet and he says that when the time come we will give it to you he has
						his throat around the necks of the people in Aden and he says by 1970 we will remove our hands
						from around your throat and no one ever challenges the concept because what white West then says
						is that they have the god-given right to give peoples around their world their freedom that is
						not true every man woman and child is born free they are enslaved by oppressors the only job of
						the oppressor is not to give freedom but to stop oppressing stop oppressing and you must
						understand that concept because you run around talking about we are going to get our
						independence instead of we are going to stop oppression and what the white man has worked a
						trick on the entire Third World talking about he is giving everybody the independence instead of
						everybody stopping the oppression of the white man we must define for ourselves and as we move
						we must be crystal clear in our definitions we cannot make any mistakes today we are playing
						with the lies of all of our peoples we will not let the white man define he is an oppressor we
						must stop his oppression he cannot give anybody their freedom he must stop oppressing them once
						you move once you move from the major assumption that the white man was oppressing rather than
						giving the freedom then you begin to recognize that when one moves to stop oppression it is
						justifiable to use any means necessary but if you do not move from that assumption you move from
						the assumption that the white man is giving you something if he's giving you something then you
						must take it on the strings that he attaches to you because he's giving it to you so when he
						says I am giving you your independence if you act like nice boys and girls shine my shoes and
						jump when I say jump I will give you my freedom but if you say you can't give it to me you've
						been oppressing me you just go for it anyway that's very important our assumptions must be
						different from the assumptions of white Western society they cannot be the same they cannot be
						the same now in relationship to that in relationship to that what the white man has done is that
						he is imposed his culture on everybody wherever he has gone wherever he has gone if in fact a
						few Africans a few Chinese a few Indians a few people from the West Indies come to England they
						adapt the cultural patterns and life institutions of the people of England why is it when the
						white man goes to another country instead of adopting the cultural patterns and life
						institutions of those given people he imposes his own upon them why is it that in Africa today
						Africans speak French Dutch and English if the white man went there to settle he would be
						speaking Swahili Ibo or whatever the tribes of those people were if he did not think that he
						himself were superior he would have accepted the cultures of other people but because because of
						his subconscious racism he imposed his culture on everybody around the world in Puerto Rico
						today English is taught for three years Spanish for two in Tanzania up to a year ago English was
						taught in high school they could not speak Swahili the reason was because the white man had a
						game it was called English he invented it it was his game it's called language if you wanted
						independence you had to play his game you can't play and win a game when somebody invents the
						rules I would like to play cards with you if you let me invent the rules if I say every time I
						have a card full of hands I win you'll never win and if you start to win and I own the cards
						I'll pick them up and go home so that we cannot play the games according to the rules of the
						white man we must define the rules for ourselves and we have no responsibility to anyone once we
						begin to define our own rules because what else the white man has done is that through that he
						has imposed the criterion for beauty around the world today beauty is that which is white is
						what the white man says it is a white woman with stringy hair with eyes skinny nose and thin
						lips that is beauty and all of the women of the world are trying their best to imitate that
						nonsense disrupting their own natural beauty their own natural beauty Iwas shocked when I found
						out the Japanese women as beautiful as they were were going on undergoing operations to make
						their eyes round isn't that disgusting I am shocked every day by Black women around the world
						who disrupt the beauty of their hair putting a hot comb in it trying to look like a white woman
						I'm thoroughly disgusted and that disgust comes again from the fact that the white man thinks
						that he can impose the criterion for beauty and what we must all begin to say around the world
						be we Chinese be we Indians be we Blacks from Africa we are made in the concept of whatever we
						are the texture of our hair the breadth of our nostrils the thickness of our lips that is what
						we are that is our color and we are beautiful in that image beautiful in that image and until we
						begin to do that we will not begin to recognize our struggles we cannot imitate the West we must
						seek to create a new society for our peoples wherever they are we cannot imitate the West we
						must seek to create a new societies based on humanity for our people we cannot imitate the West
						to imitate the West is to drop an atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki we cannot imitate the
						West to imitate the West is to invade Aden to invade Malaya to invade Zimbabwe to invade Vietnam
						to invade all over the world we cannot imitate the West we must reject the West and all of its
						concept we must create for our peoples around the world we must reject the West what has
						happened to the colored peoples around the world is that the West has divided us played us
						against each other and taking away the concept of peoplehood from us notice how white people
						have a concept of peoplehood and motherland if a white man lives for 90 years in Azania which is
						what they call South Africa he is still an Englishman he is still an Englishman if a white man
						is living in China he is still an Englishman a Frenchman or an American but take a people of
						color out of their country and they become nothing Jewish people live all around the world but
						they are Jews some of them have never stepped foot on Israel but Israel is their country and if
						you touch Israel the Jews around the world are going to come to the support of Israel but the
						people of colors do not have a concept of peoplehood because it has been maliciously and
						willfully destroyed by the white West so that you can sit in your motherland England while she
						exploits Guyana while she exploits Trinidad while she exploits Malaya while she exploits
						Zimbabwe while she exploits Nigeria while she exploits the whole Third World and no one raises a
						fuss I don't know how much they bought Aden for I know they paid 24 dollars for Manhattan from
						the Indians with some beads that is because the people of color were never concerned with
						material wealth we were just people who were concerned with moving along as we were and whenever
						white people came along because we believed in humanity we let him do all of this nonsense we
						never knew about ownership of land that was the white man's concept and he bought everything and
						all he has a bunch of papers to say he owns them the white man does not own land God did not
						give it to him land is there for the peoples of the world he can't take it can't take it so you
						don't discuss that what is going on in the world today is the fight to recover the land that the
						white man says he owns very very important and notice the same trick in India today I am
						appalled by the discussion around the world of the world being overpopulated there is enough
						food in the world to feed everybody there is enough food to feed everybody the question of
						overpopulation only arises with the colored peoples of the world that is because the white man
						does not want the numbers to rise any higher and look at the disgusting trick that he pulls a
						transistor radio for sterilization look at the tricks he pulls a transistor radio for
						sterilization but he's not a violent man he says when you talk about violence there are many
						forms that it takes Mao says politics is war without violence he continues war is politics with
						violence we are fighting political warfare around the world some of it has become war most of it
						is still in the political stages if the West continues to oppress people all of it will become
						war that question is not to resolve ironically by the peoples of the Third World it is to
						resolve by the white West if they're willing to stop oppressing people there will be no violence
						if they do not we are going to throw them off our backs by any means necessary will not discuss
						it the most violent thing that the white man could have done to us was to drug us to sleep so we
						would not even fight back notice the similarity between the Jews and the Germans they talk about
						what the Germans did to the Jews and the most awful thing they could do was to dehumanize the
						Jews to the positions where they did not fight back they have done the same thing to all of us
						they have dehumanized us to the level where we do not even rebel we accept that which they shove
						down our throats so that when they talk about violence do not get caught up the most violent
						thing to do is to sterilize a human being for a transistor radio do you know how disgusting that
						is to stop another human being from producing another human being for a goddamn radio and the
						white man doesn't say that that's violent it's quite all right as a matter of fact after all the
						world is being populated we have to stop it they're hungry in India and they're uncivilized and
						they're running over each other if they could control the resources of their country they could
						feed their peoples they cannot control the resources of their country because the West takes it
						for itself and allows the rest of its populace to live at a standard of living at the expense of
						the people of India and the rest of the world the white working class is having a lot of profit
						while the Indians are getting transistor radios I want to talk a little about the standard of
						living because standard of living today is relative unfortunately it is relative to the white
						man while it is true that most of the colored peoples who inhabit London today get a better
						standard of living than they had from the islands where they came the standard of living which
						they enjoy in England compared to the standards of living of the white man is abominable and it
						is even more abominable because they enjoy the standard of living off of the sweats of your
						brothers and sisters in the very countries which you left so that when the white man talks about
						standard of living how you're better off here than you were in Africa or in the West Indies
						they're better off because of the sweat of the peoples in the West Indies and Africa and that's
						what you must understand and that people who should be fighting to stop that most are the
						colored peoples inside of England if you began to judge it that way rather to say yes when I
						lived in Trinidad I lived in a shack now I live in a three-room apartment with seven children
						you would wipe out that nonsense to say while I live in a room with seven children the white man
						lives across the street in a big house five rooms and two children you will begin to understand
						where you're moving you judge the standard of living it is relative it is relative it is not
						absolute in the United States of America most families are moving to have two cars two cars two
						cars in India in Africa in Asia people can't even buy bicycles is it fair for the white
						population of the United States to have two cars while the rest of the world can't get bicycles
						especially since she controls the resources of the rest of the world which do not even exist
						inside her continental borders who is she kidding who does the white man think is listening to
						him any longer his platitudes have turned in his lips no one is listening to him anymore we have
						different drummers we are listening to new people and they're coming from the Third World we're
						listening to the Malcolm Xs we're listening to the Che Guevaras we're listening to the Frantz
						Fanons we're listening we're listening to the Mao Tse Tungs that's who we're listening to yes
						we're listening to the John Pokelas that's who we're listening to that's who we're listening to
						we're no longer listening to Rudyard Kipling to Hobbes and to all of that nonsense they are as
						sterile as is their writings very important we must then begin to talk about the white liberal
						in relationship to the struggles of the Third World as we see it from our point of view not from
						their point of view and from our assumptions not from their assumptions now before we begin we
						must differentiate between two types of racism around the world one is institutionalized racism
						the other is individual acts of racism and they're very very important an individual act of
						racism would be uh five white policemen beating an African student to death in North London
						that's an individual act and everybody rises and up in arms Black and White especially the white
						liberals and they say what a horrible thing that is horrible horrible that this is that or
						another act would be a 150 white savages stoning the house of a Black man see and everybody says
						what a horrible thing that is and when they go to court the judge calls it a family squabble and
						just fines the white men a few dollars that's individual acts that's what the white liberal
						would have you focus your attention on because that's individually and he can cop out
						individually because he says well see I don't do that to you and if you focus your attention on
						individual racism you will be caught in a trap we must focus our attention on institutionalized
						racism institutionalized racism is when you pick up a newspaper in London and it says for
						colored only not for colored that is institutionalized racism because what that means is that
						the entire white society is suppressing the people of color and the white liberal cannot opt out
						if you point out to him individual institutionalized racism he cannot opt out he can only cop
						out if you get caught in his trick bag about individual racism well I don't kill any of you well
						that may be true but while you don't the rest of your society is killing me then you put him
						into a position where he must clearly make a choice either against his society for you or with
						his society against you that's what we must do more and more around the world today we must do
						it individual acts of racism would be a white man named Cecil Rhodes getting up and yelling that
						white culture is the only culture that would be individual racism all the whites will say well
						you shouldn't have done that but institutionalized racism is a dirty filthy murdering white man
						named Cecil Rhodes taking Zimbawe giving it his name and stealing the diamonds from that area
						that is institutionalized racism that is institutionalized and we must force them if they say
						they are friends to take a position on Zimbabwe because if you take a position you can't talk
						about sanctions you must talk about overthrowing white power that is where we must put them if
						they are going to in fact become our friends because the white liberal comes with his
						subconscious racism which he does not recognize and when he's confronted with it he acts like
						the savage that the rest of his society is he yells at us rather than attacking the society
						which has produced that racism he finds himself incapable of condemning it so he condemns us why
						do you think the white liberals talk about Black violence that's all they talk about now it’s a
						new thing it’s their new phase white Black violence can they ever condemn white violence have
						you ever heard them say about the violence in India where you sterilize somebody for a
						transistor radio did they raise their voices against it do they raise their voices against
						Malaya do they raise their voices against Aden do they raise their voices against Hong Kong do
						they raise their voices against Zimbabwe but let a Black man pick up a gun and the whole white
						liberal structure comes down on that one Black man one Black man and that is clearly because
						they're incapable of it but now there is and see that's why I say you can't afford to make any
						alliances with them but there is another reason and this hits them hard is cause they're all
						Marxist according to their interpretation of it yes and what they say is on economic reasons
						I'll tell you why you can't align with a white liberal all of the white liberals that I know are
						rich enough to be white liberals that is to say that the white liberal enjoys a position of
						economic security from the system in which they live that very system produces a position of
						economic insecurity for the colored peoples of the world understand that you must begin to
						understand that because what you say to them is will they fight to smash the very system which
						produces economic security for them will they fight for it we must fight to smash that system
						because it produces economic insecurity for us you tell me in any Marxist doctrine where the
						economic secure joined hands with the economic insecure to form a revolution and it is because
						of that that the white liberal becomes irrelevant in the struggle and must become irrelevant in
						our struggle must become irrelevant in our struggle they are always talking about the white
						working class in the West which I have not yet seen and the reason you have not seen it and will
						not see it is because the white working class is part of the system that oppresses the Third
						World the white working class enjoys the profits of their capitalist brothers shares in that
						profit and keeps their mouth shut and that is why you have no revolutionary consciousness among
						the so-called white working class when they begin to suffer the way we suffer then you will have
						a revolutionary consciousness but they do not suffer because we are doing all the suffering very
						very important very very important look at all your labor parties in England and the United
						States they have stocks and ownership in all the capitalistic structures around the world you
						don't expect the labor union in the United States to come out against the war in Vietnam if it
						weren't for the war in Vietnam they'd be starving they must support the war in Vietnam we must
						come out against it because it's against our brothers in Vietnam and because that structure is
						also oppressing us [Applause] then what we have to do as the peoples of the Third World today is
						to begin to come together what the West did was to use our color as his reason for suppressing
						and oppressing us what we must do is use our color as the reason for coming together and
						stopping that oppression unless we begin to recognize the need to come together and to pit aside
						the petty differences that the white West plays upon we will be doomed in Guyana you have
						Indians fighting Blacks in Malaya you have Chinese fighting Indians in the West Indies you have
						Chinese fighting Indians fighting Blacks in Africa you have everybody fighting everybody else
						and the white man is sitting on top with a cigar in his mouth unless we begin to come together
						and organize ourselves for the struggle that we're about to wage we will be doomed we cannot any
						longer accept the disunity that the white man has sown in us from the Fiji Islands to the
						Caribbeans we cannot longer accept it if we do not have the same common culture if we do not
						have the same common goals if we do not have the same common ideals we have the same common
						enemy and that alone should be reason to unite us so we can defeat the enemy and get on to the
						business of hand which was disrupted so many centuries ago when the white man started his
						nonsense we must come back together and move humanity on it has been disrupted for too long we
						must begin to unify we must begin to unite we cannot let the differences keep us apart that the
						white man has played on we must begin to see that the struggles in Vietnam that the struggles in
						Aden that the struggles of the Blacks in the United States that the struggles of the Africans
						that the struggles of the Chinese that the struggles of the Latin Americans are our struggle and
						we are part and parcel of them we must begin to see that we must begin to understand that the
						bombs that are dropping in Vietnam today will tomorrow be dropping in South Africa in India and
						in Latin America even if we didn't want Vietnam to be part of us part of us if we didn't want
						Indians to be part of us if we didn't want Chinese to be part of us if we didn't want Blacks to
						be part of us if we didn't want people from Pakistan to be part of us we must make them part of
						us for our very survival for our very survival we must make them part of us that is what we have
						to do we must begin to recognize that our peoples have a place in the sun that that place in the
						sun had been stolen and robbed from them by the West it is the job of all of us today especially
						the young bloods in the younger generation around the world to come together and to restore our
						people in the place where they belong and to put the white man back in his place where he
						belongs just like another man the white man has been playing God for centuries and the reason
						he's played God for centuries is because we've let him it's time for us to tell him that play
						time is over it's time for us to let him know that we will no longer tolerate his nonsense it is
						time for us to let him know that we are forging together for our struggle for humanity and every
						time he touches one of the peoples in the Third World he's gonna go to war with all of us
						wherever we are that's what we have to tell them that's what we have to tell them we have to
						tell the white man that when his CIA and his MI 15 or whatever the hell it is overthrows a
						government in Ghana then he's got to fight all of us wherever we are we have got to let him know
						that we have got to let the West know that when they drop a bomb in Vietnam if we don't have
						bombs we will burn down their factories wherever they are that's what we've got to let them know
						we have got to forge such a unity of the Third World and such an organization so tight that we
						will let him know that it's impossible for him to oppress any man wherever he is because the
						rest of us must keep our eyes on him and we must become real and political indeed in our essence
						of bringing Western societies to its knees and into its rightful position like any other man
						until we do that we are lost if there's any message then that we can bring to you today is that
						inside the United States the African American communities have come to a position of
						revolutionary consciousness where we recognize that our struggles is not with the struggles of
						the United States but with the struggles of the peoples of the Third World we have come to tell
						you that we will not lift a gun to fight in any of their racist wars we will lift guns to fight
						against them because we are inside their bowels we have come to tell you today that we're on the
						way for our liberation inside the United States we are not talking we have talked for 400 years
						it has gotten us nowhere nowhere we are not going to talk anymore and that if we are to be
						squashed in the United States our only act to save humanity is to bring the entire country down
						and that we're willing to do that we've come to explain to you that no matter what the shades of
						your color are if you are non-white you are in the same boat that the rest of us are therefore
						you had better come on home you would better come on home we have come to tell you that the
						revolutionary consciousness that is spreading in the Third World today will not only be based on
						skin color but on ideology Tshombe is a white man he will be destroyed you had better come on
						home had better come on home we have come to tell you that if you see your lot and your culture
						being thrown with that of England then we see you as part of England who suppresses and
						oppresses us you will be with England when the lines are drawn you had better come on home home
						we have come to tell you that we're waging our liberation struggle in the United States today
						and we will wage it with our brothers in Latin America like Fidel Castro with our brothers
						around the world you had better come on home we have come finally to tell you that individualism
						is a luxury that the peoples of the Third World cannot afford you had better come on home home
						[Applause] and finally we have come to tell you that it is not love it is not morality nor is it
						non-violence that runs the world it is power we are fighting to redistribute the power in the
						world the way it should be that people should determine their own lives for themselves you had
						better come on home we have finally come to tell you that when our lives are not worth much
						wherever we go we are willing because we know that though we be killed there will be Black
						people around the world who are coming together and will continue the fight cause we are going
						to win thank you</p>

					<p>today my brothers it is indeed a great pleasure for me to be on the platform here to stand beside
						my Black brother brother Carmich Stokely Carmichael and it is also I thank you for coming up but
						I see on your faces the enthusiasm to build a new world of Black power but before you go on my
						brothers there is one thing I must let you quite uh make you aware of what Black Black power
						means because when people like Mr. Carmichael can no longer participate in this country we the
						Black brothers of this country must get together and unite by this I mean my job in the Black
						youth struggle in Britain is to go to your ghettoes and try to bring you to see the light where
						the white man has deceived you it is not easy a task for me because we have in our Black
						communities so long been indoctrinated with the white ideology that when a Black man like
						yourself comes in to tell you where you have been led astray you turn and want to fight him my
						brothers my job is to go around the country with brother Roy and brother Malcolm organizing and
						getting more Black people to attend our meetings to tell you more about your heritage we want
						you first to find yourself and then when you have found yourself you can begin to realize the
						problem which the Black man faces all over the world it is no good to get steamed up in this
						room and when you go home tomorrow you are taken into the pub and drink with your white friend I
						do not say do not drink with your white friend but I say once you drink you must watch him
						because he might add arsenic to your drink and intoxicate you when my brothers from America came
						here all what I read in the newspapers were racialists every time a Black man comes to his
						people and tries to show them where the white man has been leading them astray the white man
						turns round and says to his Black fellow men this man is is a danger he is a threat to you he is
						a threat for what you are fighting for but he never tells you what you're fighting for whenever
						you try to get together he tells you you are afraid to your other Black people you see my
						brothers the thing we forget when we come to this country admittedly most of us get an
						opportunity to better ourselves but the moment we start going up into this world we forget the
						real essential need which is the need not only of the individual but the need of the Black man
						all over the world this is the need my brothers our slogan in the young Black struggle in
						Britain today it is the cause is greater than the individual needs but I know you tell me if I
						asked you all to go and strike tomorrow you'll say well how the hell am I going to pay my rent
						because this other Black man like myself is not going to understand anything but he's four
						pounds for his stinking little room but the reason why he will not understand is because we have
						never tried to help him understand you see the thing with us in Britain all our efforts and
						energy are detracted towards America they tell us in the newspaper that our Black brothers are
						revolting against the white man but they do not explain to us why he is revolting they tell us
						that we in Britain today are living much happier than the Black man in America but I will tell
						you something my brother we are not we the Black men of Britain are dead simply because we are
						not in tune with ourselves we are living without knowing what goes on the Black man in the Afro
						Asian in America has become aware of this because of the good work that so many of our Black
						brothers have pledged their lives for like the late brother Malcolm X you see my brother unless
						we get together and forget our little differences and settle the great urgencies we are licked
						according to the English usage that means because whenever a Black man tries to tell another
						Black man what the evils which the white man has done to him because the white man has
						indoctrinated him in a white philosophy he cannot see that the great issue lies no matter how
						hard he tries to imitate the white man to be accepted to get a job to get his children educated
						you see my brother we the young ones today will be the men of tomorrow and unless we do not help
						and not put our heads together our brothers lives are in vain the struggle is no longer
						necessary we might as well sit down you know because the white man keeps telling us for 400
						years to wait what are we waiting for we are never ready we will never be ready in the eyes of
						the white man he never tells us when we go to school about the heritage of our Black people he
						tells us that our Black people are savages but the true savage is the Barbarian he is the savage
						he does not tell us that we have something to be proud of and this something to be proud of is
						our Blackness whenever a Black man starts to talk about Blackness people say that he is
						advocating racialism people say the white man then I mean by people and a few Uncle Toms who are
						in the audience but nevertheless well my brother I do not want to take all your time because I
						know you have lots of questions you want to clarify in your mind I will be coming to your
						ghettoes and try and help as much as I can but my help is in vain if you do not reciprocate with
						me when I come to your Black ghettoes I want to see your Black faces because if your Black faces
						aren't there my head is going to be beaten in so I need your support because my brother white
						men are lynching Black men in this country but you never hear of it every time a Black man
						retaliates they say he is a racialist but uh does he know there baby hang on I'm coming I'm
						coming right now I want to thank on behalf of this committee all my Black brothers all over the
						world who have come here to make this meeting possible and when brother Roy and brother Malcolm
						goes out to help you my job is to get into this community and tell you about these meetings
						because these gentlemen are wasting their times and their money out of their own pockets because
						Black people do not like dipping into their pockets to help Black people so we waste our time if
						you do not turn up to the meeting my job is to get into the community about two days before and
						tell you about it and hope and remind you that you do not sleep and forget the day because every
						time Black people want to come somewhere the first thing they say is their free drinks is their
						transportation this is the bad thing we have among ourselves but I hope after hearing the
						inspiring talk by brother Stokely Carmichael and by brother Roy you will start thinking about
						your Blackness because this is the thing that the white man always throws in our face we are
						Black remember baby the cause is greater than the individual need I'm coming hang on baby I'm
						coming </p>

					<p>the white man is dead in me it is not dead due to any psychological operation or mystical
						experience it is dead because I've lived through a revolution and I'm living through a
						revolution the Cuban Revolution a revolution that came about a revolution that came about by
						means of a violent armed rebellion we have ceased to be a colony of the white Western world we
						have become an independent nation of the Third World I I might look white Anglo-Saxon protestant
						yet for the empire of the United States I am Black this is our hour we must turn the world on
						its feet for the first time in history we are the majority of the world we are two-thirds of the
						world and revolution in the Third world will put the world on its feet for the first time in
						history the struggle now is called Vietnam it is called Ho Chi Minh it is called Black power it
						is called Malcolm X and Stokely Carmichael </p>

					<p>uh before I make the few announcements that I have I just uh wanted to take up on a few points I
						think we see where it's quite clear where where Stokely is and what his job is and what he's
						doing I think we've this is demonstrated here the question is now you know how to continue on uh
						from here from this point certainly in terms of the Dialectics and in terms of the quote white
						liberals what does everyone do Stokely is clearly of the Third World how do we become part of
						the Third World what do we have to do um I think that's a question that everyone has to wrestle
						with and come up with the answer for themselves but again it's a question of perceiving what the
						reality is I would just like to tell Stokely and some of the other people here uh of some means
						of salvation or something that's happening in the States in Chicago that I know of although I'm
						not a part of it but I know it it's existing and it's starting to happen and this is the uh
						so-called poor white population in Chicago the Hillbillies from the South they are starting to
						feel this thing also this revolutionary spirit and they're starting to realize uh just where
						they're at and what the problem has been and there are uh again what people are calling riots or
						outbreaks of violence among these people and this is with the younger people traditionally this
						has been called uh like a delinquency problem it's a social disease except now it isn't because
						these kids know where it's at and they're starting to organize along the same lines and they're
						not concerned with making it a biracial scene because they know what it's been for them and
						they're starting to do it and I think this is what everyone has to come to terms with their own
						reality and if you're Black it's Black and if you're white it's white you have to get to the
						roots of it and define yourself in that context because the third pardon yeah (interaction with
						audience) currently there are there's some people walking around here with uh uh baskets for uh
						contributions pardon okay </p>

						you have any kind of power at all take it out of your pocket and put in that bowl cause we need
						some bread now so turn aloose the money as everybody here uhm some of them are going out now but
						if you'd like to uh give the donation you know drop it in the the ladies are not collecting

					<p>the point that was not mentioned was after Stokely and brother George came to London and we had a
						series of long discussions we have decided to gather a group of young cadres who will be going
						out to the West Indies to a different island and Guyana to preach and internationalize Black
						power this meeting tonight has been called for the fundraising specifically of raising funds to
						send the young cadres to the Caribbean our sisters will be coming around and we are asking you
						to donate because every time you donate you are helping to free the Caribbean and you're also
						helping to free the Third World from the West oppression you must realize and understand that if
						we had a factory to produce ammunitions we would not need your money to buy guns we need money
						not only to buy guns but we also need money to buy bullets because with the new race laws that
						have been introduced in the United States and with the new law which is going to prevent our
						Afro-American brothers from getting arms they have got to get the arms from somewhere we need
						money to buy arms we are not begging for money for Oxfam see the trouble with this country is
						they collected money in England for the people starving in India and in India we're collecting
						money for the people starving in Ireland and in Ireland they're collecting money for the people
						starving in Africa and in the West Indies we're collecting money for the people starving in
						England this is erratic you know I am sure many of you from the West Indies when you were a
						little boy and you were in school I'm sure you used to remember during the war when our teachers
						used to tell us if you haven't got a shirt or a pants you're not using you must bring it to
						school and we will send it to our brothers and sisters in England you know when I came to
						Portobello market and I went down there I saw one of my shirts with my name on it that's the
						kind of society we live in so Ladies and Gentlemen please give generously and I'm pretty sure
						there are many of you who are long waiting to ask some questions in the meantime since we are in
						England and one must adopt the culture of a country where one goes to many of you are accustomed
						of the world's second helping so when our sisters comes around don't forget she's coming around
						for the second helping in the meantime if there are any questions let us be brief and the more
						brief you are the better you stand a chance of getting your questions answered </p>

					<p> briefly uh I think we have been all encouraged by this wonderful uh talk by our brother
						Carmichael and so on I uhm personally want to to thank him for being what he is and uh I am very
						pleased that we that in the United States the American Negro is in the vanguard of the struggle
						now I remember in 1959 when I started calling myself ram at 125th and 7th avenue and going back
						to Guyana in African robes when I was laughed at by my brethren in Guyana now I think that a new
						we have me we've been we're in a new stage with a new consciousness and I think things are going
						to change because we have begun to find ourselves to understand ourselves to understand what we
						have got to do I remember uh Ted Jones here working with me in Greenwich Village he's one of the
						leading American poets no one has mentioned about Ted but Ted has been in the struggle for a
						long time we met in Greenwich Village and worked a lot among the beatniks brother Carmichael's
						statement on the hippies I too uh want to see this thing move over from a rejection to a
						rebellion open rebellion where they could happen many of us are pessimistic because Stokely is
						also pessimistic now I want to ask uh I want Brother George here who is from SNCC or um Stokely
						to give us an idea or give us um something on the transition of the SNCC movement from the
						affairs of non-violence because you remember SNCC was student nonviolent I was one of the
						original members of SNCC at Wilberforce uh that's in Ohio and I want George to tell us something
						about or Stokely the transition how we came to realize that this non-violent thing doesn't work
						that the man is going to stand on our heads with his guns and how we moved over from that stage
						to the present stage where we are resisting with arms </p>

					</speaker>
					<p>well yes I think first of all you have to understand what kind of a movement you're starting if
						you call it a non-violent movement it means that you are raising primarily a moral question
						which means that you are hoping that there are people who will look at that and feel sorry about
						it and will help you which means that you are waging a movement which seeks to gain the sympathy
						of the oppressor which seeks to gain the support of the oppressor the ironic thing about the
						non-violent struggle is that you we were asking the oppressor to free us from our oppression
						which is a contradiction in terms but as the movement evolved people began to think in concrete
						power terms in terms of power relationships and we realized that no people had ever gained power
						no people had ever rid themselves of their oppression until they had the power to wrestle that
						oppression that to wrestle that power from the hands of the oppressor so it was this
						evolutionary progress which led people in the United States to take the position Black people
						that they are presently taking my question is we had enough talk about every revolution going
						back to the history but I think we should start organizing taking people for training and
						fighting with volunteers in south Vietnam and sending people for training in Cuba and try every
						possible ways to win this war if once if once if once if we can topple the United States
						government or change the government with the help of Mr. Stokely Carmichael and other
						compatriots I think British government will crumble like a cake now I would I would like my
						brother Stokely to give us one sense whether he will give us any lead how we can send these
						volunteers and I've got more than 60 or 70 people waiting to fight for any freedom fight which
						he chooses to be the right one and we will join him anytime I don't think that discussion should
						be public but I I I do believe that we should begin to raise a revelry revolutionary
						consciousness among the people so they can see that but when the actual business is taken care
						of and that must be a very private meeting well I have listened to Stokely Carmichael well he
						has been talking in terms of organizing the colored people in terms of Black power I would
						suggest from my experience in Europe I am specializing in business now I'm coming hold on hold
						on now would you tell me would you tell me today in Africa we have foreign banks controlled by
						foreign powers now the African banks today we have competing the foreign banks are not very very
						powerful now in America the Negroes have banks and businesses why can't the Negroes invest
						capital in African banks to make them very powerful whereby we would be able to create a sort of
						money market compelling our people to buy shares in our banks so that automatically whatever
						profit our banks make in our country would be invested in our national economy so that our
						people will have what is called purchasing power and what is your opinion could you give me your
						opinion and ideas how to sort of get the American Negro businessmen to invest in Africa so that
						our economy and our bank will become solid for expansion </p>

					<p>uh I think in answering the questions there's two things number one most of us who belong to the
						Third World have been poisoned with a saying that our people can't do anything right wherever
						we've been if it's been Black people Niggers can't do nothing right if it's been Indians Coolie
						can't do nothing right and we've been poisoned with that what we have to begin to do is to
						clarify people the beginning that they should have faith and they should have confidence in
						their own people once we do that then we can begin to bridge the gap but secondly I also think
						that what we're going to have to recognize is that the white banks have no business in Africa
						they're going to have to be bombed down to the ground and there'll be no competition </p>

					<p>as I'm student of the Free University of West Berlin Carmichael spoke of the Tarzan films I think
						what he said is right there is another film called Africa Addio the most fascist and racist film
						I ever have seen in West Berlin they tried to show this film last year we uh that means student
						movement students and their friends from the Third World moved in stopped the film destroyed the
						screens and the seats so that there's no cinema owner dared to show this film for half a year
						there then later on they say hey there's no step here uh later on they succeeded for they got a
						lot of police there and so we couldn't enter a second time this racist film I saw today is shown
						here in the very heart of London at Leicester Square if I lived in England I would I uh would
						know what to do against it </p>

					<p>we're not quite sure for a number of reasons I think that one of the reasons that we are the
						biggest threat to the United States of America is that we're inside her bowels and that means
						that she cannot use an atomic bomb or a hydrogen bomb against us now what we've come to find out
						about the United States is that she's a cowardly nation whenever she has to fight hand-to-hand
						combat she loses and she calls that guerrilla warfare and what she says is guerrilla warfare is
						a new type of warfare that's being fought in the jungle and we don't understand it so what they
						do is they get their little young scared white boys to fly a plane and just drop bombs on people
						because he can't see who he's killing and that way they can destroy villages now that's the
						advantage we have over them they can't drop bombs on us cause we're in the heart of them our
						fight with them is gonna be hand to hand combat guerrilla warfare and that's I think I think one
						of the ways that we'll be able to bring them down is by not separating if we separate and took
						two states then they can just bomb those two states very very important but if they decided to
						bomb the ghettos of the United States they would have to bomb all of their states because in
						every one of their states there's a ghetto and in every one of those ghettos there's a
						revolutionary consciousness of armed resistance that has been developed by the Black people
						inside those communities wood has just come true that we haven't got a lot of time left inside
						of here and they want us out quite soon so could the questioners please make it questions and
						not statements and all that please </p>

					<p> Mr. Chairman I would like to know how Mr. Carmichael proposes to reconcile the objects of Black
						power with the association with the war in Vietnam the association of the uh attitude of the of
						Mao Tse Tung of Mao Tse Tungism the association of uh destroying the objectives and industrial
						uh stability of the so-called white paths if we are to have we the Blacks a permanent link with
						that which is ours an association with that which is not ours Asia Asia's domination of the
						Blacks the Asians attitude to the Blacks and furthermore what has it got to do with us to fight
						to liberate the people of Vietnam when we are ourselves </p>

					<p> I uh I uh now look one of the things we're going to have to understand is that some of us all of
						us have been brain whitewashed all of us have been whitewashed and that some of us have been
						through miracles been able to begin to wrestle with the problem of our whitewashing many of us
						are still in the dark it's our problem to begin to help those who are in the dark and the best
						way to do that is to try to understand and deal with their questions now I think Sir that I said
						that although our aims our ideologies and our goals may not be the same we have the same common
						enemy for us for us not to join hands with Asia is for us to do just what the white West wants
						us to do to stay apart so that she can continue to dominate us she has told us that in the
						history books she says Bismarck discovered it divide and conquer and she's divided and conquered
						us around the world our problem now is to come together all of those peoples who have been
						oppressed by the same satieties and begin to deal our common enemy one death blow from there on
						we can begin to move to help develop our own cultures but for us to stay now and quibble about
						the Asian's attitudes towards the Blacks would be absurd we don't have the power to fight Asia
						even if we wanted to and while we were fighting Asia the white West would just sit up there and
						laugh and continue to exploit us </p>

					<p> he raises the question of the Chinese invasion of India I don't know the whole story about I'm
						not sure but even if the Chinese did invade Asia it would seem to me be better for us to sit
						down and talk with the Chinese cause I'll tell you who gonna give the Africans the h-bomb it's
						not Russia it's not France it's not the United States it's not the Chinese are going to have to
						give the bomb to the Africans for Mao's very survival give him give him a chance give him </p>

					<p> the question is what is my views towards Dr. King and the others on the attitude to um Black
						Power now publicly we never criticize any Black man cause that's been the biggest trick of uh
						yeah thank you so that what we've been able to do is to give you our analysis as we see the
						Third World Dr. King comes here quite frequently I'm told uh what you should do next time is to
						invite him to a meeting when he comes here and listen to his philosophy and decide which one you
						would pick but I think for us to get into public quarrels about Dr. King is to evade the real
						issue I'm after I'm after white society if Dr. King becomes so treacherous that he disrupts that
						which we're trying to do then we will deal with him as we deal with a white man </p>

					<p> uh Mr. Chairman uh this question just arose from an observance I've just had uh the sun probably
						more than any other day has driven out all the Black beautiful women uh I think more than any
						other time our Black intellectuals I'm not speaking about our bus drivers and the conductors for
						the time being but our leaders like Mr. Banda and Seretse Khama and uh Mr. Williams etc this is
						time for them to to involve themselves with Blackness that means we must have Black Prime
						Minister having a Black wife the queen is now the number one woman in my country she's now the
						number one woman in Malawi and the white woman is still number two Mr. Banda's wife do you think
						it's time for the Black man to take on to himself a Black woman and to mold and shape this Black
						woman into what he wants her to be do you think at this time we can afford the Black woman to
						keep for the Black woman to keep abusing her Black beautiful body trying to be what the white
						man is not only abusing the Black body but in spoiling her own future and instilling into the
						minds of her Black children the feeling of insecurity and impurity Mr. Chairman the question is
						this should this go on </p>

							<surname>Carmichael</surname>
						</persName>
					</speaker>
					<p> the answer is absolutely not and the reason is because the peoples of the Third World have been
						whitewashed so they believe that the only beautiful woman is a white woman and that what they
						must begin to understand is that their women are the most beautiful people going but what the
						white man has been able to do is to put his woman up on a pinnacle call her the queen and molest
						every other woman around the world he has raped and plundered every woman he's put his hands on
						and I don't think that the answer is to even bother with his woman but to just put our woman on
						the pinnacle where they belong they will be the queens of the world the white man the white man
						also is caught in the white man's definitions and the white definition of equality perhaps was
						the first time questioned when there was riots in Watts for the Americans and then we knew for
						instance you take care of your head when the head starts aching now the white man was
						unconscious perhaps that's true I I have gone to jail for Viet against Vietnam against different
						things like that politically I was conscious of that now how can you make me conscious of my of
						the white definitions of my white understanding of the world you can make me conscious by every
						time you there is a uh violation of you because you're Black tell me shout it each one has to
						really protest when you think you could you have to confront us open up the world we can't do it
						because we're unconscious it's not hurting us that's right it's helping us and you ha well
						period that's it what just just one more comment and that is that when you that's on the let's
						say personal level on the institutional level when you start to you know move with guns and
						things of this order there are white boys that are also going to move with guns on your side
						well I do not think that if anyone can look at the world today take a look at Vietnam take a
						look at Bolivia Peru Cuba take a look at Aden take a look at Hong Kong take a look at Africa
						take a look at Asia that they can say they're unconscious of the problems of the world I think
						you're opting out it's clear where the world is at can I can I finish now if you say that there
						are white boys who are going to be moving with guns when we move we will be glad for them to
						move with us we are still looking for them I mean we're clear on that I'm not I'm not
						condescending I mean that sincerely cause I I don't know what I would do if I were white but I
						would think that a lot that white people should pick up guns for and begin to shoot other white
						people for uh but until they do that there's no need to talk about it's hypothetical I think the
						problem with white revolutionaries is that their intellectual revolutionaries but they're not
						emotional revolutionaries because they've not been involved in a real struggle their struggle
						has been a vicarious struggle through the struggles of other peoples now that's a real problem I
						think for you as a white person I think that one of those developments can come out of what they
						call the hippie movement if they would get some political sense see or if they would stop
						playing children and grow up they would get some sense I think though ironically as it may sound
						the only time that they will start to choose is when white people start getting shot cause then
						they will have no choice either to shoot at us or join us if they recognize where the world is
						leading and if they recognize that that is what is going to happen then they will begin to
						choose sides in the United States they're still opting out they're coming to us and saying put
						your guns down we're not going to listen to them they're going to have to choose I think that'll
						be your problem you can choose some frantic signals are coming from the back down they're
						telling us please close off now we're going to have to do just that before it is you go there
						will be a couple more questions there'll also be a couple a few of the sisters again with their
						bags because it costs a lot of money to ship one man from here to the West Indies and so far the
						bird that says you all have thrown up cannot really send him halfway across the Atlantic so we
						expect you again to try your best just two more questions from the rest while the sisters are
						around I listen to Mr. Carmichael very attentively and I think no sane person can disagree with
						him but two questions generally have occurred to my mind when Mr. Carmichael talks of Black
						Power don't you feel that he seems to be a lot obsessed by the Chinese explosion of hydrogen
						bomb he talks he talks a lot of being pro-Chinese but what the Chinese have done in Tibet does
						it not mean that the Chinese are another imperialist powers don't be I think it's a matter which
						cannot be judged by being emotional and shouting what has happened in Tibet I was partly an
						eyewitness and I think by little color association Mr. Carmichael is very much preaching that we
						should go back to another imperialist power the second question which I would like to put to Mr.
						Carmichael is that although it is very immoral to give a transistor to an overpopulated people
						and ask them to be sterilized but is it not also scientific at the same time that an
						underdeveloped country should have some scientific method of controlling population I am asking
						a question is it not proper that an underdeveloped country should also have some scientific
						method of birth control </p>

					</speaker>
					<p> well let me take your last question first I do not believe in the world today there's any
						underdeveloped countries that's a white man's term I think I think there are overexploited
						countries I would not be opposed if the people of India decided that they should have some
						scientific method of birth control in the West you have scientific method of birth control you
						do not have sterilization there is a difference there is a big difference between birth control
						and sterilization and you don't have sterilization in exchange for a transistor radio it is
						crystal clear to me that if I wanted to not have babies I could have sexual intercourse and not
						have babies I do that all the time but when the but when the time comes for me to have babies I
						want to be able to reproduce if the West were really concerned with that then they could give
						people birth control pills they can give them prophylactics they can give them Emko they can
						give them a million and one things they give to their young white kids so that when those white
						kids get ready to reproduce they can do so so I think you ought to clear up the difference
						between sterilization and birth control that's very very important as to your former question I
						again I'm not sure about the discussion of China and Tibet because I'm not able to get any
						information any real information from any of those situations I only know what I'm able to get
						by reading through the lines for example I noticed that when the CIA overthrew Sukarno and
						killed over a million people there was nothing said about it nobody blinked an eye about it and
						it was clear it is clear to me what that has done I know that the one thing Mao has done is to
						put all of the white West out of his country and he has been able to develop our country within
						19 years that is a fantastic thing to do fantastic thing to do I read his books and they make
						sense to me politically I understand his moves I understand his fight for cultural integrity
						with the Red Guards I understand his fight against revisionism which is a fight inherent which
						is a fight inherent if you adopt the bureaucratic structures of the West that is why so many
						people who say they get their independence end up being hated by their very people because
						number one they turn around they adopt the same structures which have been made to oppress their
						people and they become trapped by them I also understand that Mao Tse Tung like Fidel Castro has
						armed his people and I think arming of the people is the only way to ensure the liberation of
						the struggles </p>

					<p> Mr. Speaker in the course of your speech you talked about the American CI and FBI overthrowing
						the governments of other countries I ask why should this go on and what can we do about it why
						can't the people of Latin America the Negroes in America the Africans unite and set up a
						powerful machine by which we can also overthrow the governments of our enemies I ask why should
						this go and what are we going to do about it </p>

					<p> I think that the type of meetings we've been having in London is a beginning to precisely that
						it is it is crystal clear to me that we're going to have to develop a structure that is going to
						fight the CIA and it's going to fight the MI5 unfortunately so far in the United States our only
						answer to the CIA is the M14 but as we go along we're definitely going to have to develop those
						type of structures to overthrow their governments also and that that will develop as all of us
						begin to internationalize our struggle and put aside these petty differences and begin to move
						as a united struggle to end the oppression of our peoples </p>

					<p> I would like to ask Mr. Carmichael whether he doesn't think that it's evident that uhm the
						general manifestations which are covered by the word hippie and have been so covered in this
						conference are a dialectical counterpart of the the part that he himself is playing in
						attempting to uhexterminate to repeat it because I couldn't understand it don't you think that
						what's going on and is being called the hippies is a dialectical counterpart of what you're
						doing in the whole general dialectical process of exterminating the insanity of what's called
						white civilization you can call anything like because what the reason I why I think it is in
						fact the case is it seems that uhm in one set of terms the way you could describe the whole
						thing is that the white man quote unquote has been dehumanizing objectifying rarefying the Black
						man for so long and this is precisely the same sort of thing as Hegel's example of dialectics
						where the master enslaves the servant for so long that he himself eventually becomes the slave
						of the servant because in the end what the white man has done has been to objectify himself now
						it is the Black man who is humanized and the white man who not knowing how it has happened has
						just woken up to the situation is objectified and surely it's going to help you when this
						realization spreads because white society is then just going to collapse I mean it's the
						dialectical thing is happening and two sides of it happen at the same time that's why it's
						dialectical </p>

					<p> I see the hippies at best for us as a neutral force at best I do not see the hippies as doing
						the type of things that you reply I wish they would do it the difference is that the hippies do
						not have the same type of brutal overt oppression that we do they have a psychological
						oppression or what have you which may be just as brutal but the fact is they have not begun to
						fight their oppressors they have in fact dropped out of sight of their oppressors and that
						unfortunately the peoples of the Third World cannot drop out of that oppression because it's a
						day-to-day constant thing so I think if the hippies became political and began to fight Western
						society then that would be but I think the reason why uhm white society has not begun to attack
						the hippies is because they're doing just what they want them to do they've been able to
						neutralize those which could be forming a real resistance movement inside their own society </p>

					<p> with regards to the same point uh uh I wonder what the uh members of the hippie movement will be
						doing if scenes like what happened in New York in the East Village just a few weeks ago at
						Tompkins Park are recreated where there was just a small uh number of people who were like quite
						peaceful and happy and chanting and soon there was like there was this frank police brutality in
						trying to uh break up that scene and uhm what what then again you know uh will throwing flowers
						on them help or is something else necessary and I think we this this has been escalated in the
						States uhm that the hippies are subject to more of this brutality and well what to do </p>

					<p> what happened in Tompkins Square according to the hippies who were there who were attacked by
						the police while singing was that rather than escalating the violence and projecting more
						imagery of violence and fixing the violent cops in their role as violent the hippies simply
						neutralized the violence by means of psychic mechanisms which are available to Mr. Carmichael
						too which he has not fully availed himself of yet </p>

						he's screaming down at me let the same white man come up and tell you what it is is happening he
						says let it carry on he's afraid okay I'll come off with you David hello </p>

					<p> Mr. Speaker I think you refer to Russia as an enemy of the Third World Third World as I
						understand it there is the Afro-Asian Bloc the Soviet Bloc and the Western Bloc and the Soviet
						Bloc according to my impression is on the side of the Afro-Asian Bloc is it true to assume that
						it's correct</p>

					<p> yes yes I do not believe that the Russians are on the side of the Afro-Asian bloc I do not
						believe that I do not believe that for a number of reasons number one it is crystal clear to us
						that the economy of the Soviet Union will very soon align itself with the economy of the United
						States of America I do not believe that because I watched very closely the uh sessions of the
						United General uh the General Assembly of the United Nations over the question of the Middle
						East and I saw how Russia and the United States manipulated the entire meeting to talk about
						Vietnam rather than to talk about the Middle East crisis I also saw how Russia dilly-dallied
						about giving real aid to the Egyptians but brother Mao wasted no time in giving them wheat and
						money to carry on their fight I also notice that there are two splits over which the Soviet
						Chinese split came about and the real split was Russia's position of peaceful coexistence as
						opposed to Mao's position of armed resistance and it is crystal clear to me that the Russians
						talk about peaceful coexistence because armed insurrection will disrupt will disrupt their
						economy and their way of life I noticed their police brutality against Arab students who
						demonstrated in Russia at the Israeli Israeli embassy and finally I don't think Russia ever
						really had a good revolution they just had a revisionist party and they have not armed their
						people they have not armed their people I think that it is crystal clear to all of us where
						Russia is going she is going to ally herself because her economy is going to have to be based on
						the West that is why Kosygin and Johnson spent so much time talking and the United States is
						having all these cultural exchange programs with the Soviet Union so they can begin to brainwash
						their people and move closer together so that's crystal clear to me I noticed that the United
						States gave Israel the power to develop an atomic bomb she's the only country in Africa that has
						an atomic bomb Russia has not moved to give any African country the atomic bomb the United
						States sold a nuclear reactor to the Union of South Africa which they call the Union of South
						Africa and Zania I have not seen Russia move to offset that at all I noticed that when you talk
						about nuclear test ban you have Russia the United States France and Britain all talking about it
						all of them have the hydrogen bomb they want people to stop getting the hydrogen bomb because
						they already have it what we need is people like Mao who gonna give us the hydrogen bomb
						equality will only come when everybody has a hydrogen bomb applause there's one announcement on
						Tuesday at 8 pm there will be an evening of Black poetry and jazz at the West Indian student
						center 1 Collingham Gardens Ted Jones whom you know Andrew Salkey who you just saw John La Rose
						who just spoke and beautiful poems on the Harlem Rebellion some of which we've brought over will
						be read </p>
